# Inventory App - Front-end

## This is the front-end part of a whole inventory project. You can find the backend repository in this link: <https://github.com/CristianFiguerolaVicedo/Inventory-back-end>

This app was made using `Java` for the backend with `Springboot` and `JavaScript` with `React` for the front-end

The intention of this project is to help small and medium e-commerces manage their inventory in an easy, clean and simple way and to be an alternative to the tipically used excel.

This inventory wants to be as much user-friendly as possible, making it perfect for everyone to use wether you have high technological knowledge or not.
